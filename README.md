# GalacticForge

GalacticForge aims to learn extended galactic distributions of galaxies conditioned on a set of parameters. The pipeline uses an Autoencoder trained on galaxy images to capture global properties in a latent space, which conditions a Conditional Normalizing Flow model. This approach enables the generation of galaxy distributions that account for positions, velocities, star ages, and chemical properties, among other factors.
