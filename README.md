# GalacticForge

GalacticForge aims to create priors for galaxy distribution by leveraging deep learning techniques. The pipeline uses an Autoencoder to capture global properties in a latent space, which conditions a Conditional Normalizing Flow model. This approach enables the generation of galaxy distributions that account for positions, velocities, star ages, and chemical properties, among other factors.
